   <h1>Hello Classmates!</h1> 
   <h2>My name is Melanie Huang!</h2>
   <p>I am currently a senior at SITHS and would like to pursue somehthing in the medical field so I'm not sure why I'm in this class. 
    But either way, I hope to be able to catch up to everyone else as they look like they've been coding their whole lives. I enjoy 
    playing handball, video games and binging netflix shows! </p>
